    <p>create your first microsite:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create a page for your job center advicer (Arbeitsamtbetreuer)</li>
      <li>
        the content of the page should be a image, a headline and a message --
        the message of the page should be sth like "Vielen Dank für die
        Möglichkeit" (thank you for the opportunity)
      </li>
      <li>create it as a single hero-section</li>
    </ul>

    <p>how to deploy your website:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        create a new folder and in this folder create your html, css and images
      </li>
      <li>
        the name of your html-file have to be "index.html" -- so this site will
        be used by default when visiting your page online
      </li>
      <li>
        in the end you will upload your files to github:
        <ul>
          <li>
            go to github.com
          </li>
          <li>
            create a new repository/project (make sure that you choose a good
            name, this name will be viewable in public)
          </li>
          <li>
            after creation upload your files (index.html, your css file and your
            image-files if needed) via the "upload files" link (somewhere on the
            reposiotory page)
          </li>
          <li>
            after uploading, go to the settings tab - scroll a little bit down
            until you are at the "GitHub Pages" area
          </li>
          <li>
            if you reached github pages section look for "source" and the select
            area (per default "none") - click on it and select "master branch"
          </li>
          <li>
            it will need some time to take effect (up to 1 hour for the first
            time)
          </li>
          <li>
            if it is finished you can scroll down again to the github pages area
            and you will see "Your site is published at ....", if it is not
            deployed the text is sth like "your site is currently being
            deployed"
          </li>
          <li>
            if it is active, you can also see it when you go to your repository
            main page and on the second navbar select "environment"
          </li>
        </ul>
