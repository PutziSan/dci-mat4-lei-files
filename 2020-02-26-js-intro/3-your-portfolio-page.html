    <h1>Your Portfolio page</h1>
    <p>You should try to create a page about yourself as a developper</p>
    <p>Imagine you are already 4 or 5 years active as a developper.</p>
    <p>How would your page look like?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        create an imaginary portfolio page about yourself (or a product of
        yourself like consulting, ...): <br />
        e.g. imagine you were the last 5 years developper and want to present
        yourself with this website
      </li>
      <li>
        Your are completely free about the content of your page (you can make
        one single long page with content, multiple pages)
      </li>
      <li>
        in the end, you should upload your page to github and try to present
        your own page in front of the class (on next wednesday)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>hints before starting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start from a user's perspective -- (I is in the following case your
        user):
        <ul>
          <li>Who am I?</li>
          <li>What do I want? / What am I looking for?</li>
          <li>How do I get to your website?</li>
          <li>
            What should I do in the end when vistting your website? / What
            should I feel?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Put it all together -- What is the STORY of the visitor until nhe
        reaches you out
      </li>
      <li>
        suggestion: start with the "mobile first" approach -- the mobile view of
        your page is the simple one, because it is only one single column, the
        design for the desktop is the hard one
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
