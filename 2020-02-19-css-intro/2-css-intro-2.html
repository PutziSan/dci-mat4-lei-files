        you can define for a single element multiple properties (like color)
        e.g. you can define the color inside the style-attribute and inside 
        the style-element in the head
        what finally will be applied and displayed depends on the "specificty"
     -->
    <p>this is styled via the css-rule in the head</p>

    <p>
      this has the default color, which I defined in the css-file. This is
      great!
    </p>

    <p>
      again my consistent color which I defined in the css-file
    </p>

    <p style="color: red;">LOOK, THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!</p>

    <p>exercise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create a new html-file</li>
      <li>
        again: create some styles with the style-attribute, the style-element
        inside the head and your external css-file via link
      </li>
      <li>
        create the color-property for the p-element on this 3 places, check
        which color will win and use the chrome inspect-tool to validate the
        correct color
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
