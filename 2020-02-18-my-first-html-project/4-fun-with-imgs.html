  <body>
    <p>
      this is a normal element with start- and closing-tag
    </p>
    <h2>so is this!</h2>

    <p>
      this is a self-closing-element: the break-line-element:
      <!-- the br-element will insert a line break:  -->
      <br />
      this is the next sentence and is on a new line
    </p>
    <!-- a self closing tag is 
        not allowed to use with a start- and closing-tag -->
    <!-- <br></br> <= THIS IS NOT VALID -->

    <!-- a self closing element consists only of the start-tag and do not have any content  -->

    <!-- with an img-element I can display images 
        from my local folder like this:  -->
    <img src="cover.jpg" width="100px" />

    <!-- we also can display images, which are already hosted on the internet:  -->
    <img
      src="https://images.sftcdn.net/images/t_app-cover-l,f_auto/p/ce2ece60-9b32-11e6-95ab-00163ed833e7/260663710/the-test-fun-for-friends-screenshot.jpg"
      width="100px"
    />

    <!-- using an url as an attribute-value is already known: we know it from the anchor-tag: -->
    <a href="https://google.com">this link will lead you to google</a>

    <br />
    <p>example for a broken image:</p>

    <!-- the alt tag is also very important for search-engines 
        like google so that they know what the image presents -->
    <img
      width="100px"
      src="cover.jpg"
      alt="this content will be shown if the image cannot be displayed"
    />

    <p>next exercise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        again: create a new html file and create the html barebone with the
        exclamation mark shortcut
      </li>
      <li>
        inside the body: insert some images, play around with the width, alt and
        src-attribute
      </li>
      <li>
        create images for local images (downloaded and added to your folder)
      </li>
      <li>create images for online images (with a source to another domain)</li>
      <li>use the br-element inside text to check how the linebreak works</li>
      <li>
        extra 1: create a multiple nested list (chapter example from the other
        file)
      </li>
      <li>extra 2: check the mdn documentation about the img-tag</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
