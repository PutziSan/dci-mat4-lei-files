<!-- you can insert an html-barebone via vs code with this workflow:
1. create a new html-file (with the ".html" filename extension!)
1. on the new file: write a single exclamation mark (!)
2. press enter or press tab

    <p>
      you can insert some content inside the p-tag:
      <a href="https://google.com">
        this is my link text
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      nesting tags inside each other is an important feature of html:
      <a href="">this is a nested link</a>
    </p>

    <!-- the ul-element defines an "unordered list"  -->
    <ul>
      <!-- the li-element stands for "list" and
         must be inside an ul-tag  -->
      <li>this is the first child</li>
      <li>this is the second child</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- the ol-element defines an "ordered list"  -->
    <ol>
      <!-- the li-element stands for "list" and
       must be inside an ul-tag  -->
      <li>this is the first child</li>
      <li>this is the second child</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <!-- this ul-element has no child at all -->
      <!-- this is a comment and not a child!   -->
    </ul>

    <a href="https://google.com"></a>

    <!-- the relation between ul-element and li-element is called
    a "parent-child-relationship"
    => "li" is th child of "ul"
    => "ul" is the parent of "li"
    ! an element has always ONE parent!
    but an element can have 0, 1 or multiple children
    -->

    <!-- you can nest elements as often as you want: -->

    <ul>
      <!-- this li-element is a child of ul -->
      <!-- this li-element is also the parent of the anchor-tag -->
      <li>
        this is my content with another nested element:
        <a href="https://google.com">
          this stands inside the anchor, but is also inside the list
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- an example for a nested unordered list: -->
    <ul>
      <li>
        chapter 1
        <ul>
          <li>chapter 1.1</li>
          <li>
            chapter 1.2
            <ul>
              <li>chapter 1.2.1</li>
              <li>chapter 1.2.2</li>
              <li>chapter 1.2.3</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>next exericse:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        create a new html-page and use the shortcut to create your html-barebone
      </li>
      <li>create some ordered and unordered lists</li>
      <li>
        create some paragraphs and headings (h1-h6) with nested anchor-elements
      </li>
      <li>now insert an anchor-tag inside a list-element</li>
    </ul>
