<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- <!DOCTYPE html> must be the first line 
    for any valid html file, it tells the browser 
    that the following content should be displayed
     with the html syntax -->
<!-- html is the so called "root-element" and
     every valid html-file needs the html-tag as root-element  -->
<html>
  <!-- the body-tag have to stand inside the html-tag
    everything what should be rendered from the browser
    has to stand inside the body-tag
    -->

  <!-- next exercise:
    - add a head-element to your current file
    - add a title inside the head
    - try use the live server and edit code and save it and
     check if the browser updates automatically
 -->

  <!-- inside the head stands information, which is not visible
like the title (which will be used by the browser 
as the description in the tabs)

we will use the head-element later, when we want to style our webpage
-->
  <head>
    <title>this is another title</title>
  </head>
