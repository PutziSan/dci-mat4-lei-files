<!-- in html a tagname starts with the starting-tag,
             then the content and the closing tag,
              which looks like:
            <tagname>
                content
            </tagname>
            -->
<!--  -->

<!-- the a stands for "anchor"#
and are so called "hyperlinks"
the href for the <a>-tag is called an 
    "attribute"
attributes are always included at the start tag
-->
<a href="https://google.com">
  my content
</a>

<!-- NOT correct (href is not valid for p)
but the title-attribute is a "global attribute" and 
valid for p
-->
<p href="https://google.com" title="this will appear on hover">
  my other content, will this be a link?
</p>

<p>create a new hyperlink on your page</p>
<p>check the mdn documentation and find some new attributes and test themout</p>

<!-- some rules for attributes:
1. you have to enclose them with quotation marks ("")
2. an attribute consists of: 
    the attribute-name (e.g. title),
    the equals-sign (=),
    and the value wrapped in quoation marks
-->
<!-- the href defines the target of my hyperlink  -->
<a title="the value" href="https://google.com">
  I always need some content, to be seen by a user
</a>
